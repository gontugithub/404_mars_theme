## Introduction
For the **“404s to Mars”** hackathon challenge, our team was tasked with creating a fun and innovative custom 404 error page. The challenge aimed to design a "Page Not Found" experience inspired by the theme of being lost in space on the way to Mars.

We had **2 hours** to create a first functional prototype during the hackathon, followed by **10 days** to further refine the project for our course submission. The goal was not only to build something visually appealing, but also to demonstrate our **teamwork**, **creativity**, **technical skills**, and **stress-resistant decision-making**.

## Our Process and Decisions
At the start of the hackathon, we brainstormed different ways to visually represent a missing page while staying within the space/Mars theme. After comparing ideas, we decided to create a **unique and playful concept** centered around a book.

### Concept:
We designed a web page that shows an **illustrated book** lying on a table:
- On **one side of the book**, we placed **stickers of planets**, but intentionally left out **Mars**, as it represents the “404 missing” element.
  - Instead of Mars, there is a simple circle with **“404”** written inside, making it clear that this planet cannot be found.
  
- On the **other page of the book**, we decided to show a **rocket approaching**, reinforcing the idea of a journey through space and the search for the missing planet.

### Style:
We aimed for a **cartoonish, videogame-like style** to keep the page fun, creative, and visually engaging.

### Workflow:
- **Task Distribution:** We efficiently divided tasks across the team — illustrations, layout, structure, and coding.
- **Focus on Theme and Clarity:** Every decision was made with the theme in mind, ensuring the 404 message was clear while maintaining a playful atmosphere.
- **Time Management:** We ensured that we could deliver a functional prototype within the **2-hour timeframe**, followed by refinement over the next **10 days**.

## Conclusion
This project allowed us to combine **creativity** and **technical problem-solving** in a fast-paced environment. We learned how to translate a simple concept, "404 not found," into a **story-driven visual experience** that captures attention and communicates the message effectively.

Working under time pressure helped us improve our **teamwork** and **decision-making skills**. 

Overall, we are proud of our final concept, as it reflects both the **humor** and **imagination** behind the "404s to Mars" theme.
